       <h1>Ancient India</h1> 


       <p align="justify"> The earliest authenticated human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[35]
        Nearly contemporaneous Mesolithic rock art sites have been found in many parts of the Indian subcontinent,
        including at the Bhimbetka rock shelters in Madhya Pradesh.[36] Around 7000 BCE, the first
        known Neolithic settlements appeared on the subcontinent in Mehrgarh and other sites in western
        Pakistan.[37] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[38] the first urban
        culture in South Asia;[39] it flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[40]
        Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied
        forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.</p>


     <p>   During the period 2000–500 BCE, in terms of culture, many regions of the subcontinent
        transitioned from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age.[41] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures of
        Hinduism,[42] were composed during this period,[43] and historians have analysed these to posit a
        Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[41] Most historians also consider
        this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent.
        [44][42] The caste system arose during this period, creating a hierarchy of priests, warriors,
        free peasants and traders, and lastly the indigenous peoples who were regarded as impure;
        and small tribal units gradually coalesced into monarchical, state-level polities.[45][46]
        On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of
        a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[41] In southern India, a progression to
        sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from
        this period,[47] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.</p>

       


       <h1>Politics</h1> 


      <p>  India is the world's most populous democracy.[158] A parliamentary republic with a multi-party system,[159]
        it has six recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya
        Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional parties.[160] The Congress is considered centre-left in
        Indian political culture,[161] and the BJP right-wing.[162][163][164] For most of the period between
        1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in the parliament.
        Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP,[165] as well
        as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multi-party coalitions
        at the centre.</p>

    <p>    In the Republic of India's first three general elections, in 1951, 1957, and 1962,
        the Jawaharlal Nehru-led Congress won easy victories. On Nehru's death in 1964, Lal Bahadur Shastri
        briefly became prime minister; he was succeeded, after his own unexpected death in 1966, by Indira
        Gandhi, who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971. Following public
        discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975, the Congress was voted out of power in
        1977; the then-new Janata Party, which had opposed the emergency, was voted in. Its government
        lasted just over three years. Voted back into power in 1980, the Congress saw a change in
        leadership in 1984, when Indira Gandhi was assassinated; she was succeeded by her son
        Rajiv Gandhi, who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year. The
        Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition, led by the newly formed Janata
        Dal in alliance with the Left Front, won the elections; that government too proved relatively
        short-lived, lasting just under two years.[167] Elections were held again in 1991; no party won
        an absolute majority. The Congress, as the largest single party, was able to form a minority
        government led by P. V. Narasimha Rao.</p>

        

        <h1>Government</h1>

    <p>    India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the
        Constitution of India, which serves as the country's supreme legal document.
        It is a republic and representative democracy, in which "majority rule is tempered by minority
        rights protected by law". Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the federal
        government and the states. The government abides by constitutional checks and balances. The Constitution
        of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950,[173] states in its preamble that India is a
        sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.[174] India's form of government, traditionally
        described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states,[175] has grown increasingly federal
        since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.[176][177]</p>

      <p>  The federal government comprises three branches:

           <h2>Executive:</h2> 


            The President of India is the head of state[179] and is elected indirectly by a national electoral
            college[180] for a five-year term.[181] The Prime Minister of India is the head of government
            and exercises most executive power.[182] Appointed by the president,[183] the prime minister is
            by convention supported by the party or political alliance holding the majority of seats in the
            lower house of parliament.[182] The executive branch of the Indian government consists of the
            president, the vice-president, and the Council of Ministers—the cabinet being its executive
            committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member
            of one of the houses of parliament.[179] In the Indian parliamentary system, the executive
            is subordinate to the legislature; the prime minister and his council are directly responsible
            to the lower house of the parliament.[184]</p>

         <h2>Legislative:</h2>   


          <p>  The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. It operates under a Westminster-style
            parliamentary system and comprises the upper house called the Rajya Sabha ("Council of States")
            and the lower called the Lok Sabha ("House of the People").[185] The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body
            that has 245 members who serve in staggered six-year terms.[186] Most are elected indirectly
            by the state and territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of
            the national population.[183] All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are directly elected
            by popular vote; they represent individual constituencies via five-year terms.[187] The
            remaining two members are nominated by the president from among the Anglo-Indian community,
            in case the president decides that they are not adequately represented.[188].</p>

         <h2>Judicial:</h2>   


           <p> India has a unitary three-tier independent judiciary[189] that comprises the Supreme Court,
            headed by the Chief Justice of India, 24 High Courts, and a large number of trial courts.[189]
            The Supreme Court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over
            disputes between states and the centre; it has appellate jurisdiction over the High Courts.[190]
            It has the power both to declare the law and to strike down union or state laws which contravene
            the constitution,[191] as well as to invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.</p>
