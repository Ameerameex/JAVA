Experience a journey to the southern tip of India, past 
the majestic range of the Western Ghats and sprawling green 
fields of rice paddies, to beautiful Kanyakumari, erstwhile Cape Comorin. 
Enjoy the thrill of standing on the very tip of the 
Indian sub-continent as the waves from three seas crash 
around your feet. Multi-coloured shells scattered across the
 golden sands give the beaches of Kanyakumari a vivid hue. Feel
 the goosebumps rise on your skin as you stand on Vivekananda' s Rock,
 a memorial situated on a gigantic rock 500m away from the mainland. 
 The V-shaped continent at your back and the never-ending ocean before you,
 makes you feel as though you are standing at the tip of the world. 
 Adjacent to this memorial, the Thiruvalluvar Statue rises more than
 a hundred feet to the sky, representing the teachings of the
 ancient Tamil philosopher, Thiruvalluvar. With a history that
 has roots in mythology, the temple of the Virgin Mother Goddess
 or Devi Kanya Kumari attracts millions of pilgrims every
 year. Being the location of the amazing confluence of Bay of Bengal,
 Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean, Kanyakumari offers an exhilarating 
 respite from a hectic life.
