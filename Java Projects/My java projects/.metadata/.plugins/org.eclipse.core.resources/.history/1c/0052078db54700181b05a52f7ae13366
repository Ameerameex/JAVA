History and Physical Examination
---------------------------------------------------
A detailed medical/personal history followed by a detailed physical 
examination of all organ systems may help elicit signs and symptoms 
of obvious or underlying diseases and equip your consultant to arrive
 at a diagnosis (if any) and prescribe additional tests and medication.
 
 Blood Sample Analysis
 --------------------------------------------------
Some of the basic tests that will be performed on 
the blood samples include tests for sugar levels, 
lipid levels, functioning of the liver and kidneys.

Adult vaccination counselling
---------------------------------------------------
Age, chronic disease like asthma, diabetes, frequent travel, 
medical occupation and disease exposure can increase your 
susceptibility to both infectious and seasonal disease. 
Vaccination counselling will enable your doctor to assess your risk 
for disease and suggest vaccines accordingly.


ECG
----------------------------------------------------
An ECG (Electrocardiography) is an interpretation of 
the electrical activity of your heart over a defined time 
period. An ECG is used to screen for coronary heart 
disease, myocardial infarction (heart attack) and other 
abnormalities of the heart.

Chest Radiograph
----------------------------------------------------
A chest X-ray is performed to detect abnormalities in the size, 
shape and position of your heart. It also detects abnormalities of the lungs and rib.


ECHO
----------------------------------------------------
An ECHO or echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart. 
It provides information on the size, shape and blood pumping 
capacity of the heart, as well as abnormalities within the heart.


Treadmill Test
----------------------------------------------------
A treadmill test is a form of an exercise stress test and 
it measures the heart's response to external stress. This 
test is used to detect if there are any blocks in the 
blood vessels that supply the heart muscle 
(ischemic heart disease).
