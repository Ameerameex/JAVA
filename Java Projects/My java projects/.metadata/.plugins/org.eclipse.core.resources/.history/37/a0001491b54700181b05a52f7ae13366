Telangana, and Puducherry. It also covers the verdant Union Territory of Andaman 
and Nicobar Islands. Karnataka is a coastal belt rich with Hindu traditions and 
natural beauty. It is home to forests like Bandipur and Nagarhole. The most famous 
hill station in the state is Coorg where aromatic spices and coffee plantations charm 
tourists immensely. On the other hand, Bengaluru - the IT hub of the state presents a 
perfect blend of software and sarees, bookshops and bars, tradition and modernity, and 
everything in between. Just below Karnataka lies Tamil Nadu - that boasts many
mesmerising sculptures and temple architecture of Chola Tanjore at Chidambaram. 
nother city of this state that takes pride in its creative history is Madhurai. 
You can still hear of the legendary sangrams between poets and writers that took
place here almost 2000 years ago. The most magnificent city in Tamil Nadu that
would charm you with its Carnatic music and age-old traditions is Chennai. 
Though, over the years, it has acquired a cosmopolitan glamour with contemporary 
restaurants and swanky night clubs, the temples, museums and other monuments 
of the city are worth exploring. Southern India has one of India’s most 
visited pilgrimage spots. The prominent one being the Balaji Temple at 
Tirupati in Andhra Pradesh. Also, the ancient Buddhist site of Nagarjunakonda,
and the wonderful Islamic buildings of the Qutub Shahi and Asaf Jahi dynasties at 
Golconda Fort and Hyderabad reside here. However, a strikingly different picture 
is portrayed by the most loved tourist locales of Kerala and 
Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Being a symphony of evergreen forests, 
paddy fields, coconut palms and plantations, Kerala is a lovely 
world of backwaters that make for a perfect honeymoon destination. 
Here, Ayurvedic massages, houseboat cruises, wildlife sanctuaries,
heritage zones and its local cuisine overwhelm you. And, those seeking 
pristine blue waters can hit the silver soft beaches and lush greenery of 
Andaman and Nicobar, that are the last remaining virgin rainforest islands 
in the world. Not to miss, Lakshadweep, an archipelago of 36 attols in the 
south-western coast of India that has many uninhabited and untrodden islands 
that are even more mesmerising. With a population of over 253 million, South
India has managed to blend the cuisine and culture of its diverse ethnic groups
well. The variations of its dosa, sambhar, idlis and vadas have reached
the far stretches of North and West regions. Known for its 
fresh seafood and coconut oil, it dishes out amazing chutneys 
and meat curries as well. Not to miss, the popular dance forms 
of Bharat Natyam, Kuchipudi, and Kathakali that found their origin 
in this artistically rich and prospering region.
